# CineMatch — Planned Changes

## Features
1. Input a movie or TV title, return a list of 10 similar movies as result 
2. In Recommendation list, aside from what is there, also add "why recommend" to give specific reason why this movie is similar to Hitch 
3. Reduce "why you'll love it" to a 1-liner 
4. Add a 'more recommendation" button on the top of recommendation, to refresh to a new set of recommendations 


## UI / Design
###Overall style
Change to light background. Modern smooth UX design similar to Airbnb.com style, or product hunt style. 

###Font
Font size should be at least 1-2 size up. Current font not readable. 

###Transition page (while recommendation is loading) 
Remove everything in current design. 
Build a fun/entertaining small movie-related game instead. 

###Logo 
Redesign a more modern, frontier logo to replace the current one. 

###Color scheme 
Avoid red. Use other colors to make it feel more alive (the current colors make this website look old and boring) 

###Oscar award
If there are too many award won by this film that cannot be displayed, design a hover-over and expand UX to see the full list of awards
